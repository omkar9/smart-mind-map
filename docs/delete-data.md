## How users can delete data

Smart Mind Map is an offline-first app. Most user data is stored on the user's own device.

Users can delete data using any of these methods:

1. In app:
- Delete individual mind maps from the Mind Maps screen.
- Delete node voice notes from node voice controls.
2. Device settings:
- Android Settings -> Apps -> Smart Mind Map -> Storage -> Clear Storage / Clear Data.
3. Uninstall:
- Uninstalling the app removes app-local data from the device.
4. Contact request:
- Email `omkar946@gmail.com` with subject: `Smart Mind Map Data Deletion Request`.

## What data is deleted

Deleted from device/app storage:
- Mind maps, nodes, notes, and local editor metadata.
- Voice note audio files and voice-note metadata.
- Local app settings and cached app-local records.

## What data may be kept by third parties

The app uses Google AdMob for ads. Ad-related data handled by Google systems (for example diagnostics or ad identifiers) is managed by Google under Google policies and retention rules.

## Retention period

- App-local data: removed immediately when user deletes data or clears app storage.
- Third-party AdMob-side data: retained according to Google's policies.
